## **Business Understanding**

In today's competitive landscape, understanding and effectively managing customer churn is paramount for businesses aiming to sustain growth and profitability. A churn predictive model serves as a valuable tool in this endeavor by providing insights into customer behavior and predicting which customers are likely to discontinue their relationship with the company

The business understanding of a churn predictive model encompasses several key aspects:

**Identification of Churn Factors:** By analyzing historical data and customer interactions, businesses can identify the key factors that contribute to churn. These factors may include customer demographics, purchase history, usage patterns, satisfaction levels, and engagement metrics. Understanding these factors allows businesses to tailor their retention strategies to address specific customer needs and preferences.

**Proactive Intervention:** One of the primary objectives of a churn predictive model is to enable proactive intervention. By accurately identifying customers at risk of churn, businesses can implement targeted retention efforts to mitigate the likelihood of defection. This may involve offering personalized incentives, providing enhanced customer support, or introducing new product features to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.

**Resource Allocation:** A churn predictive model helps businesses optimize resource allocation by focusing their retention efforts on customers who are most likely to churn. By prioritizing high-risk customers, businesses can allocate their time, budget, and resources more effectively, resulting in a higher return on investment for their retention initiatives.

**Customer Lifetime Value:** Understanding churn dynamics is crucial for estimating and maximizing customer lifetime value (CLV). By accurately predicting churn, businesses can identify opportunities to extend customer relationships, increase repeat purchases, and maximize revenue potential over the long term.

## **Problem Statement**

Customer churn presents a significant challenge for businesses across various industries, leading to revenue loss and decreased market share. In order to mitigate this issue, there is a critical need to develop an effective churn prediction model that can accurately forecast which customers are at risk of leaving. This model should enable companies to intervene proactively with targeted retention efforts, thereby reducing churn rates and improving overall customer retention.

## **Main Objective**
Develop a reliable and precise predictive models capable of forecasting customer churn risks, enabling companies to intervene with tailored retention measures before customers defect. Utilize insights from these models to devise and execute impactful retention strategies, including targeted marketing initiatives, personalized incentives, enhanced customer service, and product enhancements.

### Specific Objectives
---

1. **Data preprocessing:** Cleanse and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the accuracy and  reliability of the predictive model.

2. **Feature selection:** Select relevant features that have a significant impact on churn prediction while reducing dimensionality and improving model performance.

3. **Model selection:** Evaluate various machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to identify the most suitable model for predicting customer churn, considering factors such as accuracy, interpretability, and scalability.

4. **Model training and validation:** Train the chosen model on a subset of the data and validate its performance using cross-validation techniques to ensure generalizability and robustness.

5. **Hyperparameter tuning:** Optimize the parameters of the selected model using techniques such as grid search or random search to improve predictive accuracy and minimize overfitting.

6. **Evaluation metrics:** Define appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC), to assess the performance of the churn prediction model objectively.
